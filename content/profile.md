## Using ```cProfile``` to investigate performance

While ```%timeit``` can provide good benchmarking information on single lines or single functions,
larger codebases have more complex function hierarchies which require more sofisticated tools to
traverse properly. Python comes with two [built-in tools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
to profile code, which implement the same interface: ```cProfile``` and ```profile```. 
These tools can help to identify performance bottlenecks in the code. 

In this lesson, we will use ```cProfile``` due to its smaller overhead (```profile```, on the other hand,
is more extensible). The standard syntax to call it is:

```bash
$ python -m cProfile [-o <outputFile>] <python_module>
```

By default, ```cProfile``` writes the results to ```stdout```, but the optional ```-o``` flag redirects 
the output to file instead. A report can be generated using the ```pstats``` command.

Let's profile the ```wordcount``` script and write the results to a file.

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: env

:::{tab-item} IPython / Jupyter
:sync: ipy

The ```%run``` magic supports profiling out-of-the-box using the ```-p``` flag. The script can be run as:

```ipython
In [1]: %run -p -D wordcount.prof source/wordcount.py data/concat.txt processed_data/concat.dat
 
*** Profile stats marshalled to file 'wordcount.prof'.
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Unix Shell
:sync: sh

We can call ```cProfile``` as:

```bash
$ python -m cProfile -o wordcount.prof source/wordcount.py data/concat.txt processed_data/concat.dat
```

We can then generate a report using the ```pstats``` command:

```bash
$ python -m pstats wordcount.prof
# Welcome to the profile statistics browser.
# wordcount.prof% sort tottime
# wordcount.prof% stats
# Wed Sep 25 11:52:27 2024    wordcount.prof

:::{discussion}

Profiling introduces a non-negligible overhead on the code being executed. Thus, the absolute values
for time being spent in each function should be taken with a grain of salt. The real objective lies in understanding
the *relative* amount of time spent in each function call.

## Using SnakeViz to visualise performance reports

[SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) is a browser-based visualiser of
performance reports generated by ```cProfile```. It is already included among the 
dependecies installed in this virtual/Conda environment.

::::::{type-along}

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} IPython / Jupyter
:sync: ipy

SnakeViz has a IPython magic to profile and open a browser directly. To use it, we just 
need to load the relevant extension and run it:

```ipython
In [4]: %load_ext snakeviz
In [5]: %snakeviz wordcount.word_count("data/concat.txt", "processed_data/concat.dat", 1)
```

:::{warning}
This will run only if the source IPython instance has access to a local web browser. 
This also means that, e.g., if you are on Windows and following the tutorial in WSL,
this will `not` work.
:::

::::{tab-item} Unix Shell
:sync: ipy

We can run SnakeViz as:

```bash
$ snakeviz wordcount.prof --server
```

Based on the output, we can clearly see that the ```update_word_counts()``` function
is where most of the runtime of the script is spent.

## Using ```line_profiler``` to inspect the expensive function

Once the main performance-intensive function is identified, we can further examine it
to find bottlenecks. This can be done using the ```line_profiler``` tool, which returns a line-by-line 
breakdown of where time is spent. 

:::::{type-along}

Let's profile the ```wordcount``` script and write the results to a file.

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: env

:::{tab-item} IPython / Jupyter
:sync: ipy

The ```line_profiler``` package provides a magic to be used in IPython. First, the 
magic needs to be loaded:

```ipython
In [1]: %load_ext line_profiler
```

The script can be run with the ```%lprun``` magic, whose syntax is very close to the ```%run```
introduced above. Notice that we have to explicitly mention which functions we want to step through 
line by line:

```ipython
In [5]: %lprun -f wordcount.update_word_counts wordcount.word_count("data/concat.txt", "processed_data/concat.dat", 1)
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Unix Shell
:sync: sh


To use ```line_profiler``` from the command line, the functions to be profiled need to be explicitly marked.
For this reason, we need to import the relevant decorator at the beginning of the ```wordcount.py``` script:

```python
from line_profiler import profile
```

We can now mark the ```update_word_counts``` function with the ```@profile``` decorator:

```python
@profile
def update_word_counts(line, counts):
```

Profiling is performed with a script called ```kernprof```. Its usage is the following:

```console
kernprof -lvr source/wordcount.py data/concat.txt processed_data/concat.dat
```
The ```-l``` flag ensures that the function is profiled step-by-step, the ```-v``` flag 
shows the result on stdout and the ```-r``` flag is used to have rich format on output.

Based on the output, we can conclude that most of the time is spent replacing delimiters.
