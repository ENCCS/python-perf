## Intended learning outcomes

By the end of a workshop covering this lesson, learners should
be able to:

- gain a better understanding of common performance bottlenecks in Python
- profile, to measure the speed of distinct parts of the code
- benchmark, to quantify the overall performance of their code
- optimize, to alleviate bottlenecks
- parallelize, to scale up and reduce time to solution

## Timing

## Preparing exercises

e.g. what to do the day before to set up common repositories.

- Have a working Python installation.
